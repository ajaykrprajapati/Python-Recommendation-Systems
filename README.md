# Python-Recommendation-Systems
Building a Recommendation System with Python Machine Learning &amp; AI

Discover how to use Python—and some essential machine learning concepts—to build programs that can make recommendations. In this hands-on course, Lillian Pierson, P.E. covers the different types of recommendation systems out there, and shows how to build each one. She helps you learn the concepts behind how recommendation systems work by taking you through a series of examples and exercises. Once you're familiar with the underlying concepts, Lillian explains how to apply statistical and machine learning methods to construct your own recommenders. She demonstrates how to build a popularity-based recommender using the Pandas library, how to recommend similar items based on correlation, and how to deploy various machine learning algorithms to make recommendations. At the end of the course, she shows how to evaluate which recommender performed the best.
